abstract = {In previous work, we introduced an approach to program verification based on characteristic formulae. The approach consists of generating a higher-order logic formula from the source code of a program. This characteristic formula is constructed in such a way that it gives a sound and complete description of the semantics of that program. The formula can thus be exploited in an interactive proof assistant to formally verify that the program satisfies a particular specification.This previous work was, however, only concerned with purely-functional programs. In the present paper, we describe the generalization of characteristic formulae to an imperative programming language. In this setting, characteristic formulae involve specifications expressed in the style of Separation Logic. They also integrate the frame rule, which enables local reasoning. We have implemented a tool based on characteristic formulae. This tool, called CFML, supports the verification of imperative Caml programs using the Coq proof assistant. Using CFML, we have formally verified nontrivial imperative algorithms, as well as CPS functions, higher-order iterators, and programs involving higher-order stores.},

We build upon Gospel, a specification language for OCaml that can be used both in dynamic and static analyses. We employ Ortac, for runtime assertion checking, and Cameleer and CFML for the deductive verification of OCaml code. We report on the use of such tools to build a case study of collaborative analysis of a non-trivial OCaml program. This shows how these tools nicely complement each others, while at the same highlights the differences when writing specification targeting dynamic or static analysis methods.",

abstract = {Runtime assertion checking (RAC) is a convenient set of techniques that lets developers abstract away the process of verifying the correctness of their programs by writing formal specifications and automating their verification at runtime.In this work, we present ortac, a runtime assertion checking tool for OCaml libraries and programs. OCaml is a functional programming language in which idioms rely on an expressive type system, modules, and interface abstractions. ortac consumes interfaces annotated with type invariants and function contracts and produces code wrappers with the same signature that check these specifications at runtime. It provides a flexible framework for traditional assertion checking, monitoring misbehaviors without interruptions, and automated fuzz testing for OCaml programs.This paper presents an overview of ortac features and highlights its main design choices.},
